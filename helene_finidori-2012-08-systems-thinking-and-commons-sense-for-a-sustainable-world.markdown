### Systems Thinking and 'Commons-Sense' for a Sustainable World

_These notes are inspired from a group discussion __addressing the question 
from UN Secretary General on an Economic Model for survival, i__n [discussion 
since Feb 2011 on][37]__[ the LinkedIn "Systems Thinking World" forum][37]. 
__6500+ posts._[_ _][37]

_  
_

_It builds upon the intents of ["Commons based economic models" submitted to 
the 2012 RioDialogues.org][38] process __ __and the various articles on the 
commons I have posted here._

_  
_

_This is a work in progress that seeks to look at the commons and our transitioning 
to a more sustainable and resilient model in a systemic way. I welcome your 
comments and suggestions._

_ _

                                                              ------

  

**The commons are vital for our sustenance, our social cohesion and our well-being **[ An archetype?]**  
**

**  
**

We think of the commons as the [shared environment and the medium of exchange][39] 
that all people use and change, inherit and create, and then transmit to future 
generations. It connects us and fuels or nurtures much of what we produce and 
accomplish. It is vital for our sustenance and livelihood, our individual expression 
and  purpose, our social cohesion, quality of  life and well-being. The  commons 
also embody the relationships we build between people and with the earth, our 
communities and each of their kinds of knowledge.  It's an inheritance all 
humans now need a living vision of and a feeling of commons responsibility 
for.

  

**The commons take various shapes **[At the same time object - process - output] 

* The 'Assets' - The Common Wealth, inherited or created that are shared in common 
and serve a livelihood (natural, social & cultural resources, genetic and biologic 
diversity, knowledge, etc) theat people can take care of, nurture, replenish                         

* A culture - The Common Ethos, ways of being and doing in common that manifests 
in commoning (caring, sharing, in connection with others with empathy, equity, 
justice, mindfulness...)                        

* A resultant - The Common Good (well being, quality of life, prosperity, abundance)  

These become 'inputs' for the next generation, so it's a cycle… 

  

**Principles of the living commons**

**  
**

The commons concept embraces living systems complexity, a multiplicity of wholes 
in partnership. Awareness of each whole enables the parts to be responsive, 
to self-realize while being conscious of each other and of the whole. To be 
responsive takes awareness of and respect for the internal world and operating 
system of any part, even when hidden from outside view and only visible in 
its behavior. This awareness allows responsiveness to be active and to anticipate 
potential conflict or collaboration. It allows the recognition of cultural 
and ecological organization with multilevel boundaries, object and behavior 
dependent, not arbitrary.

**The living commons as a guiding image for a socio-cultural shift**

 

A living commons approach brings sustainability and resilience to another level 
adding dimensions of mutuality, common interest and a vision of the whole where 
mankind is meant to thrive.  

 

As such it constitutes a relevant transition informing image for the socio-cultural 
shift that our world requires. The Changing Image of man survey from the Stanford 
research institute lists the [following characteristics for a transition informing 
principle][41]:

* provide a holistic sense and perspective on life 
* entail an ecological ethic  
* entail a self-realization ethic  
* be multileveled, multifaceted, and integrative  
* lead to a balancing and coordinating of satisfactions along many dimensions  
 
* be experimental and open-ended

To which we can add the principles of natural systems and change for evolution 
in the physical world 

* responsiveness to our dramatically changeable knowledge and living world  
* the self-organization of complementary roles expanding the whole 
* emergence of new individuals by growth leading to new partnerships 
* continuity of change by successions of relationships 

**The commons as a whole**

**  
**

In the past, environmental efforts concentrated on protecting the earth's "special 
places", and most attention grabbing problems.  These efforts protected only 
selected parts of the commons, as threats to the whole grew unabated.  A different 
approach is needed to counter the forces of an economy that exert ever increasing 
pressure on all parts of humanity and the earth at once.  A thriving commons 
requires no parts to be excluded from attention, to assure local solutions 
don't create global conflict and global activities don't create local and regional 
conflict.   We need a whole system approach not a piecemeal approach that enables 
all parts to thrive while addressing the threat that itself is not piecemeal, 
but to the whole at once.

  

Awareness of the needs of the commons, as what all parts share a need for, 
starts with each part discovering how it uses and depends of the whole. We 
need to work toward the systemic level with a transition informing process 
concentrating on a few leverage points first, to help generate insight and 
positive feedback loops. Our recommendations include:

  

**Local organization for local needs **[P2P, many to many]

  
![][42]

**  
**

Communities must be encouraged to cultivate and produce their own livelihoods 
and co-govern their utilities, services and resources. A variety of innovative, 
creative small and **local initiatives and projects** are actively pursuing 
alternative and more sustainable forms of agriculture, industrial production, 
social and economic organization, currencies and credit systems, education, 
(self-)governance, and ways of life. Communities develop a sense of ownership 
of the process, a sense of immediacy, transparency and shared destiny that 
foster trust and resilience. Local collaboration and peer to peer (P2P) dependencies 
are something graspable and immediate, and also expand awareness of what empowers 
one another and larger systems, creating channels by which they can discover 
opportunity and be brought into balance.  **Continual community learning** 
about how those regional systems work should be encouraged and supported. This 
is key to sustaining the complexity of larger scales of integration, and the 
specialization of remote services that empowers them. **Then trust, co-creation 
and co-governance** practice and working skills develop at each scale, and 
so also spread to the whole in a distributed manner. This encourages conflict 
resolution and transparency approaches.  It develops a sense of enduring responsibility 
for the commons and roles shared with future generations.

  

**Coordinated Regional Emergency Interventions** 

  

An immediate application would be to promote the use and testing of these innovative 
methods and initiatives in ‘innovation zones’ established in areas damaged 
by disasters, or to reverse damage caused by past and current  practice.  Promote 
the study of how interventions affect each scale of the systems they take place 
in.  Responding to the threats of disasters, cultural and technological dislocations, 
as a need to develop resiliency and adaptability, and so also anticipating, 
avoiding and allowing more effective response, should all be be encouraged 
and funded, now aimed at making the commons work more smoothly as a whole too.   
Projects directly aimed at relieving the growth of crippling debt without continued 
growth of demands on the earth are inseparable from reducing emissions, reversing 
desertification, soil erosion, deforestation, overfishing, increased disparity 
between rich and poor,  corruption, abuse of power. 

  

**Expanding cooperation at higher levels and wider scales **[subsidiarity principle] 

  
![][43]

  

Expand on the "whole system"  approach to learn from example, to mimic the 
conflict-free self-organization observable in natural economic systems, and 
other "exemplars" recognized good design.  Identify simple principles for a  
more realistic and purposeful science of economics and management for an  animated 
world, drawing from "systems intervention", "action learning",  "systems thinking" 
and "whole system assessment" practices, among others, to deal with the systemic 
complexity of the relationships and the shift required. Learn from grassroots 
community practices and early adopters to foster growing awareness in each 
locality of the nature of local and global integration. Promote "connections" 
conversations to help build on interactions and facilitate integrated shifts 
in larger and smaller scale practices allowing stakeholders to discover new 
ways to solve their mutual problems. Adopt appreciative methods of enquiry 
and conflict resolution, being open to seing things as they are.  Encourage 
questioning, learning, discovery and innovation, and our capacity to bootstrap, 
to invent seeds of change, plant and nurture them, and evolve. Find ways to 
work together and actively engage in learning processes that enable co-creation 
and co-governance and conflict resolution on all scales. This includes finding 
more practical means of enforcement for laws, treaties, and agreements at all 
levels by making them confirmations of the common needs. 

  

**A Commons Sector, alongside the Private and public sectors**

**  
**

Develop  a commons sector, alongside the private and public sectors, conferring 
rights and responsibilities to communities over resources on which they depend. 
This would prevent the double risk of 'Tragedy of the commons' either from 
overexploitation by individual parts detrimental to the whole or from private 
enclosure and appropriation for the benefit of the few. This would ensure that 
the people who have a long-term stake in the preservation of these resources 
(natural, physical, intellectual, social, cultural; from local to global) would 
protect them while enabling the development of a flourishing commons-based 
economy around them. The commons would be the foundation of the collaborative 
free markets needed for the health of competitive free markets. This involves 
new forms of cooperatively or mutually governed institutions to govern the 
commons at various levels. This may include linking and embedding the commons 
in existing systems such as the international  commons of Outer Space, Antarctica 
and the Law of the Sea.>  See approaches here: [Blueprint for P2P society][44] 
by Michel Bauwens, ['Stewardship Corporations'][45] by Jack Harich; [Commons 
Trusts][46] and [Social Charters][47] developped by James Quilligan and the 
Global Commons Trust.

  

**Transition to a circular economy**

  
![http://jamesbarber.mycouncillor.org.uk/files/2012/03/linear-circular-economy.jpg][48]

      

Our economy's current purpose is to maximize flows (of goods, capital). It 
is a machine for perpetual growth that uses its profits and its knowledge to 
continually escalate its demands on humanity and on the earth and to constantly 
multiply its capacity to inflate itself as private wealth and power. As such, 
it is brittle and prone to breakdown, undermining productive activity as well 
as leading to the abuse of the commons in a never ending spiral. 

  

The "circular economy" model focuses on optimizing the flow of goods and services 
over time in relation to the size of capital and resources (stocks). It is 
a replenishing and regenerative model based on closed loops and systems resilience, 
and the rebuilding of natural and social capital. Products are designed for 
more complex cycles of disassembly and reuse, the out-design of waste and toxic 
emissions. This entails a natural shift towards renewables and internalization 
of externalities. Introducing clarity between consumables and durables, it 
puts the responsibility of the performance of the product and its becoming 
as a new resource at the end of its life on the producers, leading to a whole 
new approach of production, consumption and ownership as it  encourages leasing, 
renting and sharing while giving way to new approaches of business co-evolution 
and integration of the commons. In systems terms the system will be exhibiting 
increased 

interdependence and the use of different scales, niches and possibiities. See 
[The circular Economy][49] and the [Compression Institute][50].

  

In the spirit of circular economy closed loop urbanization and community utility 
& production systems and projects and initiatives that have multiple effects, 
and serve several different objectives, such as co-generation, closed water/energy/food 
production systems or solutions such as developed by the [Blue Economy][51][][51] 
or systemic approaches around buildings/energy/transport should be encouraged.  

  

More generally, sustainability as "circular economy", also involves that whatever 
available resource or asset businesses or other economic actors don't use, 
other parts of their environment can, with mutual benefits. This includes local 
policies to make use of idle resources to strengthen local economies.

  

**Use finance to grow the commons.**

**  
**

The transition to a circular economy for the investment and financial commons 
must start at **natural limits to profitable growth and for vitality and balance**, 
sustaining investment profitability and guiding investors to higher purposes 
for their profits than putting money into the productive economy to take growing 
amounts out of it.  The world economy doesn’t yet have a "purpose" to live 
better, only to grow and grow even as it becomes unprofitable, brittle and 
toxic. The practical transition is for investors of all kinds to find higher 
purposes for their profits, such as healing both their world and environment, 
avoiding direct liability for growing hidden impacts, and in the spirit of 
the commons and well-being. See articles [A biomimicry for self-regulating 
commons][52] and [Self Organization as niche making ][53]

  

The circular economy can contribute to create a positive entrainment effect.  
How profits are used however is a more general question of politics (= individual 
and collective choice). In the economic sphere there is an acknowledgement 
that as externalised costs become internalised benefits prices will increasingly 
reveal full costs. Shifts from taxing income to taxing non renewable resources 
and waste will reinforce this, as will real world commodities and energy price 
rises. The removal of perverse subsidies which promote resource over use would 
add impetus. Since money and money as debt is an endogenous variable in the 
whole game an unaltered financial sector undermines efforts and money will 
work best as a medium of exchange (issued debt free). Other ideas include the 
use of negative interest rates to promote long term investment in productive 
activities (see Bernard Lietaer) as against the compound growth driver which 
is compound interest that systemically reduces future value  to negligeable. 

  

**Stop growing toxic and harmful practices**

** **

This process can be accelerated by identifying and targeting investment practices 
that systemically undermine productive activity and future prospects, such 
as speculative manipulation of finance instruments and resource shortages, 
mechanisms causing systemic credit and asset bubbles, development of addictive 
appetites of various nature at the cost of public, environmental and financial 
health, the promotion of faster use of depleting resources serving to increase 
not decrease the economy's dependence on them, etc.  These are both some of 
the most profitable investments and increase rapidly as people take the profits 
from them to inflate their investment in them. This include creating incentives, 
regulations and taxes and eliminating subsidies and loopholes that encourage 
these practices.

  

**>> As a leverage point: **to remedy the above reinforce and enforce anti-corruption 
laws and eliminate 'legal' corruption and political manipulation by banning 
or strongly limiting the use of private funds for political financing and political 
speach.    See: (Larry Lessig, the founder of creative commons is campaigning 
against this see [Republic Lost][54], Jack Harich's [study of political power][55]. 

  

**Methods of assessment and reporting**

  
![][56]

**  
**

Promote transparency and reporting for monitoring and evaluation systems.   
Create  metrics to measure impacts and outcomes, that measure each part's demand 
on and contribution to the whole, and not just local visible effects.  Provide 
open access to knowledge, data, and information to allow comparative studies 
and the correction of misconceptions. Promote a general knowledge commons, 
and creative commons, allowing all to see inside the silos of others so their 
different views of common subjects, their values and ideas, can be understood 
and connected. Share methods for recognizing irreversible processes and anticipating 
their tipping points of transformation as well as recognizing seeds of change 
and anticipation of limits of change. Set up processes to ensure that what 
follows is right and continues to be right, exploring means of confirmation, 
and a meta-process of reflection and evaluation of measures. Enable trial and 
error and the possibilities to  readjust.  Respond to the abuse of misleading 
and selective metrics and evaluation systems, defining subjects with only selective 
variables, and generally assure the fidelity of information to its subjects 
and their changes.  Apply rules of fiduciary duty to the speach of corporations 
and lobbyists,   to be liable for being misleading about the true interests 
of their   investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders, as having   
natural concerns for their own and their society's wellbeing. See [Jay Youngdahl's 
expansion of fiduciary law at Harvard][57].[][57]

  

**Frameworks and platforms**

**  
**

These approaches would be well supported with frameworks and platforms to deal with the systemic complexity of the relationships and the shift required.  A platform would help the various problematiques and existing initiatives to be made visible to each other and encouraged in the context of a global sustainability & resilience objective, and to connect the dots in order to help people pull and pool resources and collaborate to grow what works for them and for the common good. It would enable learning, exchange of knowledge and experience, coordination of cooperation and action, and evaluation, debate, deliberation, decisions of specific projects or outcomes. Ultimately this could facilitate the first steps and adjustments of the formation of commons institutions that would enable the creation of the actual institutions. (see [A Global Framework)][58]  

  

Ultimately, such frameworks and platforms could be an instrument for the transition, 
providing the support for the embodied characteristics of the transition informing 
principle listed above to become visible as interconnected in a whole, and 
enabling an application of solutions at multiple levels and a discovery journey 
in the learning and accomplishment cycle of the transition:

* 'wake-up calls' -- alerting to issues;  
* understanding the issues;  
* inspiring, empowering, enabling people to collaboration and action;  
* facilitating deliberation and implementation;  
* diffusing, applying, improving, sustaining solutions  
* monitoring performance, accountability, early detection of new issues 

All this in an emergent manner. (See [platform project][59])

Reproducing here an interesting point of discussion about this article from 
another forum: 

> "I'm not really steeped in conversations about the commons, but I've found 
the conversations are often contentious. It seems to me that one of the fault 
lines is a division over the relative importance of competition versus cooperation. 

I'm not authority but like what Noam Chomsky said:

"The “New Spirit of the Age” cannot tolerate the pre-capitalist conception 
of the Forest as the shared endowment of the community at large, cared for 
communally for its own use and for future generations, protected from privatization, 
from transfer to the hands of private power for service to wealth, not needs." 

The commons like the economy isn't so much a thing but a doing. It is "the 
shared endowment of the community at large, cared for communally.""

and 

> "What is meant by the term "Commons" in these kinds of discussions? It seems 
like a lot of people are concerned with this entity, the "Commons", they want 
to protect its resources, etc.. What is it exactly? Is there anything tangible 
in this "Commons"?"

My response: 

I agree the commons are contentious (and I would suggest they are contentious 
as a term more than as a concept) because often invoked in politicized terms 
or contexts. This came out in our LI conversations as well. I like [your] definition 
of a "shared endowment of the community at large, cared for communally", in 
line with the definition offered in my article which tries to be as integrative 
and unpolarized (archetypal?) as possible. The recognition of the need to take 
care of this endowment can contribute to entrain the system in a virtuous circle... 
This can arise from love, reason, political or religious stand, conservatism 
(of resources), good household type management, risk prevention, generosity 
etc... 

The commons can be intangible as well as tangible. The objects (forest, knowledge, 
gene pool), process/culture (taking care of something as a community), outcomes 
(livelihood, wellbeing etc...). People see them in different ways depending 
on their beliefs, sensibilities and cognitive functioning. It goes back to 
your comment on debategraph, which is not intuitive to you, but is intuitive 
to others (super intuitive to me for example). 

This shows that people must gain access to learning and discovery of possibilities 
via different points of entry that corresponds to what they would be the most 
comfortable with 'intuitively'. 

I was wondering how the commons 'archetype' could be expressed in different ways to 'speak' to different types..."

Another comment:

"I'm new to the Commons discourse. I'm in the observation phase. Not sure what 
to make of it. I see the same discussions going on in several different places 
and the discussion seems to be the same.. I'm instinctively wary when I see 
that. If I look at an actual discourse, say Sociology, I will see thousands 
of people, tens of thousands if not more, engaging in a discourse, but every 
instance will be distinct, unique. I find it extremely unlikely that a discourse 
is being truly formalized if all the speakers are repeating the same thing. 
That sounds more like a Metanarrative or Ideology than the actual formalization 
of a discourse.. However, I'm not ready to come to any conclusions, since I'm 
still an outsider, an observer from the outside. I'm interested in taking each 
component, each concept of the conceptual system of Commons-ism and seeing 
where it came from, who helped develop the concept, including which publishing 
companies and their parent companies first published the foundational texts. 
A lot of it sounds a little like a religious discourse, a bizarre strand of 
Pantheism, or even something from the Catholic Worker Movement, Distributism, 
Christian anarchism.. Lots of anarcho-communist stuff, it seems, libertarian 
socialism.. The reason I'm asking for a bibliography is so I can join into 
the conversation, which I haven't been able to do now consistently for the 
last several years.."

My response:

Indeed the commons have been around for ever. I am not sure that it is an intentionally 
developed concept as a basis for an ideology and that there is one commons 
discourse, but rather multiple commons discourses and multiple 'attractors' 
to the commons. I rather see it as an archetype - probably the reason why I 
and others try to attempt an overarching definition of it...- as I suggest 
in the response above.

A few resources on the commons. Many different feels and venture points...

Helene, Glad I wasn't skipping over things and noticed this link in your STW 
comments. I've printed it out to read more carefully, but I think it's just 
what I was hoping you'd do. It seems to read wonderfully. I'll back link it 
to my "milieu" post that seemed to work for us too.

Here is A comment from Tom Atlee in another discussion thread ([https://www.facebook.com/groups/120497731371323/permalink/348583501896077/),][77] 
who just wrote a book Empowering Public Wisdom to deal with similar issues: 

"This discussion and the items we list as our priorities as CEO of the world 
dance around the possibility of a "pattern language for a healthy civilization". 
A pattern language articulates design elements (things to keep in mind, guidances 
for wisely solving common design problems) and the relations between those 
"patterns".

Three sample pattern languages along those lines are

* a sustainable economy - [http://reliableprosperity.net][78]  
 * good group process - [http://groupworksdeck.org][79]  
 * communities that have "the quality that has no name" (the original pattern language) -  
[http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/patternsframegreen.htm?/leveltwo/../apl/twopanelnlb.htm][80]

I've been involved in two pattern language projects. The co-creation of such 
an intellectual magnum opus is a monumental and evolving task. I love the idea, 
but don't know where the energy would come from to do it. The reward is a framework 
that can be used in everything from transformational organizing to sustainability 
education to inspiration for people's individual missions in life - to say 
nothing of the pure beauty of a well-crafted pattern language.

Perhaps the greatest challenge is the different perspectives and ways of thinking that each participant in such an undertaking brings to the project. That is also the greatest potential gift. A key factor in co-intelligence is using diversity creatively. It is not easy, but if successful, the result is deeper insight into the whole that we are all part of, and that is trying to emerge among and through us."
